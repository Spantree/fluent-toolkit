# Issue 1: Claude Code Installation and Version Checks

## ✅ COMPLETED — Phase 1: Core Implementation

- [x] Created `checkClaudeCodeInstallation()` with version detection
- [x] Added semver parsing and comparison logic
- [x] Implemented version caching with 5-minute TTL
- [x] Added installation method detection (npm, brew, winget)

## ✅ COMPLETED — Phase 2: User Experience

- [x] Three scenarios: Not installed, outdated, upgrade available
- [x] Interactive prompts with command preview
- [x] Automatic install/upgrade with user confirmation
- [x] Changelog fetching between versions
- [x] Fallback to manual instructions

## ✅ COMPLETED — Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

- [x] Unit tests for all scenarios (23 tests)
- [x] Integration tests for --no-prompt mode
- [x] Documentation in CLAUDE.md
- [x] PR description with comprehensive details

## ✅ COMPLETED — Phase 4: Configuration

- [x] `MIN_CLAUDE_VERSION` constant (0.3.0)
- [x] `--skip-checks` flag for bypassing checks
- [x] `--no-prompt` flag for manual instructions only
- [x] Justfile commands for development workflow

## observations

- [architecture] Semver comparison handles pre-release versions correctly #claude-code #version-checking
- [design-decision] Chose 5-minute cache TTL to balance performance and accuracy #caching
- [integration] Changelog fetching uses GitHub API to show what's new between versions #user-experience
- [limitation] Linux lacks standard installation method, shows manual instructions only #platform-support
