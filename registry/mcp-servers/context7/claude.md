### Context7

**Purpose**: Official library and framework documentation with up-to-date code examples.

**When to Use**:
- Official API references for frameworks and libraries
- Version-specific technical specifications
- Integration examples for architectural analysis
- Verifying technical claims before documentation
- Framework best practices and patterns

**When NOT to Use**:
- General web search (use Exa or Firecrawl if available)
- Community tutorials or blog posts (use Firecrawl if available)
- Business intelligence or market research (use Exa if available)
- Content not available in official documentation

**Tool Selection**:
- **Context7**: Official docs, API refs, framework patterns
- **Exa** (if installed): Semantic research, company intelligence, comprehensive analysis
- **Firecrawl** (if installed): Blog posts, tutorials, when Context7 lacks coverage

**Usage**: Request documentation for specific libraries:

**Examples**:
```
Get documentation for Express.js middleware patterns using context7

Show me the latest React hooks API from official documentation

Look up Django authentication best practices
```

**Note**: Works without an API key for basic usage. For higher rate limits and private repository access, add your API key to .env.mcp.secrets.

**Integration with Other MCPs**:
- Use Context7 FIRST for official technical documentation (most authoritative)
- Use Exa (if installed) for broader research when Context7 doesn't have coverage
- Use Sequential (if installed) to analyze Context7 docs for architectural implications
- Use Basic Memory (if installed) to document verified patterns with source attribution
- Use Firecrawl (if installed) as fallback for tutorials and community content
